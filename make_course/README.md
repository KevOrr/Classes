## EEL 4935 MAKE: Hands-On Engineering Design

Spring 2016

[The USF MAKE Course][Website] teaches the basic skills for engineering design projects. In 15 weeks students learn using CAD software, realizing their designs with 3D printers, building control systems using a microcontroller (Arduino), and writing code in C++.

I am working on an interactive Solar System model for the MAKE Course. You can learn more by following the links below.
